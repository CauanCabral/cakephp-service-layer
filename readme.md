This is more a design pattern and conceptual idea than a lot of code and will improve the maintainability of your code base. This plugin just provides some classes to help you using it.

## Introduction

The rule of thumb in any MVC framework is basically "fat models, skinny controllers".

While this works pretty well the abstraction can be done even better by separating for example the DB operations from the actual [business logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic). Most Cake developers probably use the table objects as a bucket for everything. This is, strictly speaking, not correct. A table object should just encapsulate whatever is in the direct concern of that table. Queries related to that table, custom finders and so on. Some of the principles we want to follow are [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) and [single responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle). A service layer helps with that.

The service class, a custom made class, not part of the CakePHP framework, would implement the real business logic and do any kind of calculations or whatever else logic operations need to be done and pass the result back to the controller which would then pass that result to the view.

This ensures that each part of the code is easy to test and exchange. For example the service is as well usable in a shell app because it doesn't depend on the controller. If well separated you could, in theory, have a plugin with all your table objects and share it between two apps because the application logic, specific to each app, would be implemented in the service player *not* in the table objects.

## How to use it

CakePHP by default uses locators instead of a dependency injection container. This plugin gives you a CakePHP fashioned service locator and a trait so you can simply load services anywhere in your application by using the trait.

There is also a ServicePaginatorTrait that allows you to use pagination inside your services with repository objects like the table objects.

```php
use Burzum\Cake\Service\ServiceAwareTrait;

class AppController extends Controller
{
    use ServiceAwareTrait;
}

class FooController extends AppController
{
    public function initialize()
    {
        parent::initialize();
        $this->loadService('SomeService');
    }

    /**
     * Get a list of something for the current logged in user
     */
    public function index()
    {
        $this->set('results', $this->SomeService->listingForUser(
            $this->Auth->user('id')
            $this->request
        ));
    }
}
```

If there is already a property with the name of the service used in the controller a warning will be thrown. In an ideal case your controller won't have to use any table instances anyway when using services. The tables are not a concern of the controller.

## Why no DI container?

You could archive the very same by using a DI container of your choice but there was never really a need to do so before, the locators work just fine as well and they're less bloat than adding a full DI container lib. There was no need to add a DI container to any CakePHP app in the past ~10 years for me, not even in big projects with 500+ tables. One of the core concepts of CakePHP is to go by conventions over wiring things together in a huge DI config or using a container all over the place that is in most cases anyway just used like a super global bucket by many developers.

This is of course a very opinionated topic, so if you disagree and want to go for a DI container, feel free to do so! It's awesome to have a choice!
